- 👋 Hi, I’m @rosska2.  I'm a data scientist with 15 years of experience and a PhD in Physics.  Highly skilled in research methods and complex data analysis.  
- 👀 I’m interested in statistics and data science applied to a wide variety of domains (ideally outside of physics at the moment - really excited to learn aboud different things!).  I've recently been involved in homelessness response and biostatistics projects. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning algorithms and time series analysis.  I'm nearing the end of a Masters of Applied Statistics degree with Data Science Specialization, and am extending and practicing my knowledge by doing some side projects. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun data projects!   
- 📫 How to reach me kate.ross@colostate.edu
